Musica Shila is a web3 music/media streaming platform, focused on giving the artist the freedom to control their content.

It’s everything that makes streaming media great, without the money-hungry middlemen that drain aspiring independent artists.

**What makes Musica Shila Different**
We’re artists too, and we know how the current business model of streaming platforms is for artists is either limited or not that good. The companies have their pockets full, and the artists make a fraction of a cent of a dollar a stream. 

Also, we’ve been keeping up with web3 innovations, and, if implemented correctly, can change the music industry as we know it.

**Infrastructure with Lens Protocol**
We plan on building completely on Lens protocol. We believe that it’s the perfect platform for our vision, since we saw the presentation of how to build with lens, Profile Nfts posts and collect module, etc. Thanks to how complete it is and how passionate everyone involved with Lens is. Pure fire.
Every song/video/artwork an artist uploads to Musica Shila, would be a post attached to a Collect Module with lens that listeners will be able to mint. 
This Nft will carry a Logic that for each second the content of the post is listened it will pay a respective amount of money to the artist. Money that listeners will pay as a subscription that makes them able to claim Nfts.
Once Nfts are minted and in the address of the listener’s profile, the platform will allow them to listen to the songs, make playlists with them, with or without internet.
Besides giving artists money the Nft will also make the listeners stake points for each second they listen, points that every artist will choose how to use what dynamics they can do with their community, let's say for example: if you have 1000 listening points you have free ticket for the next show, merch, etc.

Superfluid is the perfect platform to use for royalties and payments, thanks to it’s on-chain instant cashflow and gassless transfers. 
Superfluid will also help handle the subscription model we have in mind, in order to pay artist what they deserve.

**Decentralized Storage**
A media-posting/streaming platform wouldn’t be decentralized without decentralized storage. We plan to use as ,lens posts are storage, decentralized storage protocols such as IPFS, armweave or fleek.

**Team**
We (Erminio and Adriel) are not very experienced programmers, even less experienced web3 devs, thats why we couldn’t manage to present a full project just the idea and potential we see with lens and web3 that will change media industry forever. 
We in fact play in a music group, Necromorfo, which has been active for almost 6 years. As we’ve grown with the band, we realized many harsh truths about the music industry. How they treat artists, money-hungry managers with no morals, and streaming platforms giving us crumbs as payment only per stream, only by soulless numbers. 

This project is an idea of how with lens protocol and web3 we can change the media and music industry forever, and really we desperately want to be a part of it.

Thanks.
